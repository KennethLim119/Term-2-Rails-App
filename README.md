# Term-2-Rails-App
The second term in Vivixx bootcamp, we have learned about ruby on rails and made a simple application. The app itself makes you put your name and you can put any comment.

### Features
 this app is all about :
  - security system that that asks for the username and password of the admin
  - username and password is "admin"
  - putting a name and comment.
  - deleting, editing and viewing the poeple's name and their comments.
  - only authenticated users can delete comments.

### Ruby versions
- All versions

### How to use this app
1. opening the site will show you a link on the left by clicking it, it will bring you to another page.
2. put your name and you can put any comments and confirm it.
3. after confirming it, you will be directed it will show your name and comment now you have a choice if you want to view or edit. you will see a delete botton but if you press delete a pop up will show asking for the username and password. The password and username is "admin".
4. by clicking the link that shows back you can make another name and comment section and just repeat the steps.
